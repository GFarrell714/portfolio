For the PyBank anaysis, you will find the required text document, that the python script generated, in the "analysis_PyBank" directory.

Regarding the PyPoll data anaysis, if you run the python script you will receive an error statement. The error message is caused by the removal of the csv file that the code anaylized. The csv file had to be removed due it's voluminous size preventing this assignment, as a whole, from be added to my homework folder in github.

Lastly, just as with the text document in the PyBank anaysis, the text document generated from the PyPoll script can be found in the "anaysis_PyPoll" directory.
