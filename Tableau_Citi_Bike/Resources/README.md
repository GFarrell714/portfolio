The maps displayed do more than simply reinforce the blatant socio-economics inequities that city officials refuse to acknowledge, they also serve as a microcosm,
representing the tempestuous state of our current union and the world at large. As dispayed in the graphs/maps, one can easily see ascertain that the speciific 
data points (where the larger the point, the more popular the station) show no variation in a stations popularity from the summer months in 2019, as compared to 
the popularity by station an entire year later. When you factor in the per-capita-income variable that underlies these maps, it becomes glaringly appearant that this 
bike-share organiiztion is only utilized in the upper-class, high-society regions of the city. Unfortunately, we are left to reflect, not on the individuals 
this company is truly servicing, but rather on those individuals who are excluded from the benefits affored by this "nobel" start-up. To summarize the findings 
of the data analyzed, I leave you with this - If you can visualize these maps, and appreciate the insight they provife, then you clearly are not blind to the 
caste-like system that this service and activity perpetuates.
