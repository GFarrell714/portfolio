This is an example of Machine Learning, and its application in healthcare, specifically, as it pertains to Diabetic care. I pulled data from a previous study that attempted to predict the likelihood that a patient in a hospital setting would develop diabetes. The prredictions, which served as the features of my model, were the presence of specific symptoms associated with diabetes. After trainiug and fitting several models, I disocvered that the best ML model for my end goal was KNN, or K closest neighbor. The KNN model uses logistical regression and classification as it main functions to ascertain the relationships that exist between several data points.
